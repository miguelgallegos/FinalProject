Hello Professor Smith,

Enclosed is an updated version that includes our work towards the serialization extra credit part.   

Current functionality includes the ability to serialize the initial settings (i.e. custInitialAmount, bankVaultAmount, numberCustomers, numberTellers, custGoal, maxTransactionAmount), to be saved between sessions in SOAP format.  User is given the choice to use saved values or default values.    Note that new values are saved once the user hits the "Stop" button.

Also put some hours into serializing full state with customers, transactions, etc, but not there yet.   

Thanks!
